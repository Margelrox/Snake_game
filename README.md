Hello, this is my first time using git.
This file is a Snake_game (do you remember snake on nokia cellphones?), i wrote the code in classroom and take me 20
minutes for coding, the logic was elaborated by ChatGPT, is for entertainment purposes and for upgrade my coding skill
I going to update the snake game, with better sprites to reach new skills on programing.
So that is all :D
